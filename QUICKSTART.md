# Quick Start Guide

Get your todo app running in **4 simple steps**!

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed (check with `node --version`)
- A Supabase account (free: https://supabase.com)

## Step 1: Create Supabase Project (2 minutes)

1. Go to https://supabase.com and sign up/log in
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Fill in:
   - Name: `todo-app` (or whatever you like)
   - Database Password: *choose a strong password*
   - Region: *closest to you*
4. Click **"Create new project"** and wait ~2 minutes

## Step 2: Run Database Setup (1 minute)

1. In your Supabase project, click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"New Query"**
3. Open the file `all-in-one.sql` from your `todo-app` folder
4. Copy the entire contents and paste into the SQL Editor
5. Click **"Run"** (or press `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`)
6. You should see: ✅ "Success. No rows returned"

**Done!** Your database is set up with:
- `todos` table created
- Row-level security configured
- 8 sample todos added for testing

## Step 3: Run Automated Setup (1 minute)

In your terminal, navigate to the `todo-app` folder and run:

```bash
cd todo-app
./setup.sh
```

Or if that doesn't work:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

The script will:
- ✅ Install dependencies (`npm install`)
- ✅ Prompt for your Supabase credentials
- ✅ Create `.env` file automatically
- ✅ Ask if you want to migrate existing `todos.json` data
- ✅ Confirm everything is ready

**You'll need:**
- **SUPABASE_URL**: Get from Supabase → Settings → API (looks like `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
- **SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY**: Same page, under "Project API keys" → `service_role` key

## Step 4: Start Your App!

```bash
npm start
```

Open your browser to **http://localhost:3000**

**You're done! 🎉**

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" when running setup.sh
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### Can't find SUPABASE_URL or SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Click **Settings** → **API**
3. Copy:
   - **URL** field → This is your `SUPABASE_URL`
   - **service_role** key (click "Reveal" button) → This is your `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`

### Error: "relation 'todos' does not exist"
You didn't run `all-in-one.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor. Go back to Step 2.

### Port 3000 already in use
When running `setup.sh`, enter a different port (e.g., `3001`) when prompted, or edit `.env` and change `PORT=3000` to `PORT=3001`.

## What's Next?

Your app is running! Now you can:

- ✅ Add, edit, delete, and complete todos
- ✅ View stats at the bottom
- ✅ Access your data from anywhere (it's in Supabase!)
- ✅ Check the database in Supabase → Table Editor → `todos`
